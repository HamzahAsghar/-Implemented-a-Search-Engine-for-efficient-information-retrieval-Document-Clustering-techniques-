# Search Engine with Document Clustering
This project implements a search engine for efficient information retrieval, along with a document clustering system for grouping similar content. The search engine uses web crawling, indexing, and ranking algorithms, while clustering algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering are used to organize documents.

# Key Features
Search Engine: Crawling, indexing, and ranking algorithms for document retrieval.
Document Clustering: Uses techniques like k-means and TF-IDF for grouping similar documents.
Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette score and purity to measure clustering performance.

# Tools Used
1. Python: 
Development language
2. Beautiful Soup:
 Web crawling
3. Clustering Algorithms:
 K-means, hierarchical clustering

# Conclusion
The system provides efficient document retrieval and meaningful document clustering, enabling users to discover insights from large data sets.
